""" Vision Transformer (ViT) in PyTorch copy from timm

A PyTorch implement of Vision Transformers as described in:

'An Image Is Worth 16 x 16 Words: Transformers for Image Recognition at Scale'
    - https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.11929

`How to train your ViT? Data, Augmentation, and Regularization in Vision Transformers`
    - https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.10270

`FlexiViT: One Model for All Patch Sizes`
    - https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.08013

The official jax code is released and available at
  * https://github.com/google-research/vision_transformer
  * https://github.com/google-research/big_vision

Acknowledgments:
  * The paper authors for releasing code and weights, thanks!
  * I fixed my class token impl based on Phil Wang's https://github.com/lucidrains/vit-pytorch
  * Simple transformer style inspired by Andrej Karpathy's https://github.com/karpathy/minGPT
  * Bert reference code checks against Huggingface Transformers and Tensorflow Bert
